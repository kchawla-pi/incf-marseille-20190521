Hello.
My name and role are here.
This is what I will talk about.
We have 10 minutes. Lets get to it.

The sponsors of my salary told me I have to namedrop our open source project, so here it is.

But this could be for any project.

I like to think we have created a successful Open Source Project.
Here I articulate some thoughts about what helps. Some are mine, many from giants whose shoulders I stand on.

What is the story your project is telling?
------------------------------------------

I tried making the slides for this presntation. I couldn't. I listed a bunch of good, clear points but could not think of what to say for each of them.
So I wrote a story to organize my thoughts. Then it became easy to make the slides.
We need a good narrative to be able to think about what to make.

WHat story does your softwre tell?

Nilearn's story is that it does MVPA analysis of fMRI data, it is simple to use and easy to contribute to.
Once we knew this is our story, it also became our guiding principle, everytime we made design decisions.

We chose Python not C++ etc, becuse it made it easier to contribute to by other users.
We preferred useing functions, using classes only where necessary.

Think from a User Perspective
-----------------------------

If you have seen the movie "Being John Malkovich", in the movie there's a magical room in where you get to experience life through the eyes of the titular character, John Malkovich.
You see what he sees, feel what he feels, and so on.

Sit in front of the PC, try to install your project.
Ask someone from outside your circle, without giving them 'tips and suggestion', "Hey! Here's the documentation link. Install it and give me feedback."

Is it an easy pip install and done? 
Or does one have to tweak configurations? 
Manually install 10 dependencies for most of the functionality?
Download this binary from here and add it to the PATH?
Every step adds inertia.
Make your project easy to install. Do the heavy lifting for the users.

If there're a lot of barriers in installing the software, the stroy is askew.
