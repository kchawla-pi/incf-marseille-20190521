LEt them know

Neuroinfo framework

Pros in the domain
Bad at sharing software and data
Wake them up

focus on org, efficient, share software, data

We have successful exp with nilearn, we wanna share them.
Unwritten rules - OSS< online disccussions, open discussion, 
involve community in design choice
dont chase all features


This is interesting to these ppl.

Pitch Nilearn in that direction.


Poster:
How to make an OSS successful, nilearn as example.


Think of main messages.


Main Message(?): How did we build Nilearn so successfully??
Discuss this wit Gael also

Take a user perspective in everything:
Only python code
docs not feature
simplicity of use
API consistency
Make it easy to install
Avoid Framework
Think in terms of Community not technique.
Convex Optimizaton...huh? Have the language of community irrespective of background. Manafging social aspects of community is more important thatn forcing self perspective on sofrwaee desifn


Dont share latest contribution in community library. Share robust things, not latest thing done. Reliable work is much more important than fancy feature.
Most OSS fail due to this.. Do we have a concrete exmple?
Methods like FREM. Paper 2yrs old, feature now. Not until we were sure it was ribust and reliable.

Dont focus on the gui first.(Contentious maybe)

Be social: Coding sprint, hackathon, conferences, neurostars user engagement.

Our rules
First Target Users who will also be developers.
End user not a developer will cost a lot.
Another reason to not start with a GUI.

Always have a demonstrative real world example.

Jake Vogel exaple, interaction and encouragement of new contributors, stick with python not c++ for more contributors.


Ask Camille maybe about a lightning talk:

Make it open, have discussions online, involve community in design choices, not all feature requests - focus on the few important things.
